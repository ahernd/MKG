INTRODUCTIONThe improvement of quality of care fordiabetic patients is at the core of the St VincentDeclaration {1}.
"In Germany, the care is sharedbetween physicians, either generalists or specia-lists, in private practice and hospitals."
Numerousstudies have examined the quality of care ingeneral practice and hospitals in the UK [2~but comparable evidence is scarce in Germany[8].
The Sheffield study [6] demonstrated thatonly 23% of diabetic patients discharged fromhospital without plans for routine follow-upwere seen at routine appointments by theirgeneral practitioner and that 20% thought theywere cured.
"In Germany, medical reports are sent from thehospital to the general practitioner after dicharge of the patient from hospital."
"Medicalreports are non-standardized documentsdesigned to state the diagnostic conclusions andtherapeutic recommendations, to advise optimaltreatment and to alert the physician of impend-ing complications."
We conducted a retrospectivestudy involving the analysis of 752 medicalreports of diabetic patients to investigate thequality of documentation relevant to diabetesthe general physician obtains from our hospital.
"PATIENTS AND METHODSWe included 843 consecutive medical reports Received 11 March 1996, accepted 26 July 1996."
