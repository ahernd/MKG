HEPP  Diabetes Center and III Department of Medicine of the Municipal Hospital, Munich-Bogenhausen, EnglschalkingerstraGe 77, 81925 Munich, Germany  In a retrospective analysis of 752 consecutive medical reports of patients with insulin- or non- insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, we investi- gated the completeness of documentation of indicators of quality of care.  The medical reports are the currently used form of documentation ‘hich is sent to the General Practitioner after the patient's discharge from hospital.  The indicators of care were data on clinical history, physical examination, laboratory results and secondary complications.   The documentation was incomplete; e. g.  in 8. 0% of insulin-dependent (IDDM) and in 26. 4% of nominsulin-dependent diabetics (NIDDM), HbAle was missing.  In 7. 6%, the type of diabetes was not stated.  The frequency of recorded secondary complications was lower than ithas to be expected considering metabolic control and duration of diabetes of the studied group.  Documentation was more complete for IDDM.  tients.  The reports of NIDDM patients with incipient or overt diabetic nephropathy revealed less frequent recordings of data on lipid metabo- lism and blood pressure compared to the group without nephropathy.   ‘The documentation of indicators of quality of care in medical reports for general practitioners is incomplete for many diabetic inpatients.  Standar- dized methods of documentation are required urgently.  Copyright © 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.

INTRODUCTION  The improvement of quality of care for diabetic patients is at the core of the St Vincent Declaration {1}.  In Germany, the care is shared between physicians, either generalists or specia- lists, in private practice and hospitals.  Numerous studies have examined the quality of care in general practice and hospitals in the UK [2~ but comparable evidence is scarce in Germany [8].  The Sheffield study [6] demonstrated that only 23% of diabetic patients discharged from hospital without plans for routine follow-up were seen at routine appointments by their general practitioner and that 20% thought they were cured.   In Germany, medical reports are sent from the hospital to the general practitioner after di charge of the patient from hospital.  Medical reports are non-standardized documents designed to state the diagnostic conclusions and therapeutic recommendations, to advise optimal treatment and to alert the physician of impend- ing complications.  We conducted a retrospective study involving the analysis of 752 medical reports of diabetic patients to investigate the quality of documentation relevant to diabetes the general physician obtains from our hospital.       PATIENTS AND METHODS We included 843 consecutive medical reports    Received 11 March 1996, accepted 26 July 1996.   ‘Correspondence to: B.
